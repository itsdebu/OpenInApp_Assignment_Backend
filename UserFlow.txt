Flow Of Task Management App:

UserSignup/Login -> jwt generated -> use jwt in further apis for authentication->

task creation -> subtask creation -> updation of both -> deletion.

Cron Logic -> priorityupdate in every 12hours -> calling happen in every x minutes acc to the logic based on priority.

Three Api's:
1- User
	A- user signup/login
	B- getAlltasks
	C- getAllsubtask

2- task
	A- task create
	B- task update
	C- task delete(Soft)
	D- deleted task

3- Subtask
	A- subtask create
	B- subtask update
	C- subtask delete(Soft)
	D- deleted Subtask
4- Cronjob
	A-update priority
	B-Voicecall acc to priority


Edge Cases:
1. Status of tasks should not be in hand of user it should be changed acc to the subtasks status.

2. When all the subtask is deleted then status should be TODO again.

3. After Soft Deletion task or subtask should not be visibe in get all apis.

4. When a task is deleted then its subtask should also be deleted (Soft Deletion).

5. User Can also get then deleted task or subtask.

6. while creating subtask the status should be updated.

7. While deleted of subtask the status should be updated.
